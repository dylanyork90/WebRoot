            <li><p><a href="http://w3schools.com">W3Schools</a><br /> 
                W3Schools is a great as an introduction to nearly all things needed to know in order to author pages
                this is value because there are a lot of tutorials and example
                of a lot of languages. This is valuable to anyone who is working
                on the web as a resource for authoring web apps. 
                I can use this site to look up information about designing web apps i don't know 
                and learn new things that i want to implement in my web app.<br/>

                it talks about four main platforms AngularJS, ASP.Net, Node.js, and PHP and gives a small paragraph with
                bullet points explaining what each platform exceeds at and why you should use it. 
                it is not helpful to us right now but it can help us out in the future when we want to use 
                different platforms besides Node.js <br/>

                This article is about 39 different tools that are used in web development.
                it talks about tools such as notpadd++ and Visula studio code for code and text editors to 
                front end frameworks giving details about how each system works and if it is right for you.
                I can see this being useful since people like having their own applications could be better for them then others
